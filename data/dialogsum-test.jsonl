So first, right off the bat, When looking at the marketing plan, tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with...\n#Person2#: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...\n#Person1#: That's correct. If you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. Now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. First, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year. Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts. If you look at the overhead, you'll see a graph... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005, the red line is the sales in 2006... As you can see, our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with, but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year. On the other hand, you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket.","summary":"#Person1# and #Person2# discuss the marketing goals they set this year to begin with and evaluate their sale performance which has grown greatly."}

This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.
